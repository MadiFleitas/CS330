# CS330 Final Project - 3D Scene Management

This project is part of the CS330 course, focusing on Computational Graphics and Visualization. The project involves creating a 3D scene management system using OpenGL, which includes managing textures, materials, lighting, and rendering various 3D shapes.

# Journal

## How do I approach designing software?
For designing software, I start by understanding the project requirements and breaking them down into smaller components. I think about how each part should interact and consider what makes the user experience more intuitive. My work on the 3D scene project helped me develop skills in planning the layout and structure of 3D objects, as well as optimizing how they render. I learned to consider how different shapes, textures, and lighting can impact the final outcome and how to manage the complexity of a scene to keep it running smoothly.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The 3D scene project helped me develop skills in organizing 3D layouts and choosing textures and lighting that enhance the scene's realism. I also improved my ability to optimize rendering by balancing visual quality with performance, which is crucial for creating efficient graphics.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed involved sketching out initial ideas for the scene, deciding on the basic shapes and textures I wanted to include, and then refining those choices based on how they looked in the actual rendering. I would test out different configurations, see how they performed, and make adjustments. This iterative approach allowed me to fine-tune the details and create a more realistic and engaging scene.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics I used, such as breaking the project into smaller tasks and iteratively refining the design, can definitely be applied to future projects, whether they involve graphics or other areas of software development. This approach helps in managing complexity and ensures a polished final result.

## How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I aim to build incrementally. I start with a basic setup and then add features piece by piece, testing each change to ensure it works as expected. This helps catch errors early and makes the development process smoother.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
For the 3D scene, I adopted strategies like optimizing the rendering loop to improve performance and experimenting with different shader effects to achieve the desired look. These strategies helped in maintaining a balance between high-quality visuals and efficient execution.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was key, as I needed to tweak the lighting and textures multiple times to get the right balance between visual quality and performance. This approach allowed me to gradually improve the scene based on testing and feedback.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Throughout the project milestones, my approach to developing code evolved from simply trying to get things to work to thinking more about how to make the code efficient and maintainable. I learned to refactor sections that were repetitive or didn't perform well and to use libraries more effectively to achieve complex visual effects. This growth helped me not only complete the project but also improve the quality of the final output.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is a powerful tool because it allows me to solve problems and create solutions that are both functional and creative. It provides the skills needed to develop programs, design software, and understand complex concepts, which are all essential for achieving my career aspirations.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me new skills, such as understanding how to manipulate objects in 3D space and apply visual effects, which can be useful in future coursework that involves simulations or graphical analysis.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, these skills are valuable for fields like game development, virtual reality, or any role that requires creating visual representations of data, making it easier to communicate complex ideas through images rather than words.\

## Features
- 3D scene management with transformations (scaling, rotation, translation).
- Material properties definition for different objects (e.g., wood, metal, glass).
- Multiple light source configurations (directional, point, and spotlight).
- Texture loading and application to various 3D shapes.
- Shapes included: plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, and box.

## Project Structure
The main source files for the project are located in the `Projects/7-1_FinalProjectMilestones` directory. Key components include:

- `SceneManager.cpp`: Handles the preparation and rendering of the 3D scene.
- `ViewManager.h/cpp`: Manages the view and camera settings.
- Textures are located in the `textures/` folder.
- Material definitions are managed within the `DefineObjectMaterials()` function.
